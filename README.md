# StreamBee Platform Analytics: User Behavior & Revenue Optimization

*A comprehensive data analytics project demonstrating SQL expertise and business intelligence insights for streaming platform optimization*

---

## Project Overview

As a **Data Analyst at StreamBee**, a growing streaming entertainment platform, I conducted an in-depth analysis of user behavior and platform performance following our major content library expansion and interface redesign. This project leverages **BigQuery** for advanced SQL analytics and **Looker Studio** for executive-level data visualization.

**StreamBee** recently launched an enhanced content library featuring original series, documentaries, and premium movies, alongside a completely redesigned user interface. With increased competition from established players like Netflix, Disney+, and Spotify, understanding user engagement patterns and optimizing monetization strategies has become critical for sustainable growth.
